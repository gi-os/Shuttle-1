# Design Details Folder

## Overview
This folder contains text files that define your company's branding, including the company name, color scheme, and key descriptions used throughout the website.

## Required Files

```
Details/
├── README.md           # This file
├── CompanyName.txt     # Your company name (REQUIRED)
├── Colors.txt          # Color scheme (REQUIRED)
├── Descriptions.txt    # Taglines and descriptions (REQUIRED)
├── Hotels.txt          # Hotel dropdown, when hotel_list is on
└── Brands.txt          # Brand dropdown, when brand_list is on (STS-4.1.0)
```

### Brands.txt (STS-4.1.0)

Populates the "which brand are you submitting for" dropdown at checkout when
`brand_list: true` is set in `DATABASE/Presets/DataRequired.txt`.

One brand per line. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

```
# Brand List
Clinique
La Mer
Jo Malone London
```

If the file is missing or has no entries, the checkout falls back to a
free-text input, so an unpopulated list never blocks a submission.

## How to Edit

### Changing Company Name
1. Open `CompanyName.txt` in a text editor
2. Replace the entire content with your company name
3. Save the file
4. Changes appear on next page load

### Updating Colors
1. Open `Colors.txt` in a text editor
2. Modify the hex color values (keep the # symbol)
3. Maintain the `key: value` format
4. Save the file
5. Restart development server to see changes

### Modifying Descriptions
1. Open `Descriptions.txt` in a text editor
2. Update the value after the colon
3. Keep each key: value on the same line
4. Save the file
5. Changes appear on next page load

## For AI Assistants

When modifying these files:

### Before Editing:
1. **Always read the existing file first** to understand current content
2. **Preserve the format** - Don't change file structure
3. **Validate hex colors** - Ensure they start with # and are 6 digits
4. **Check for typos** - Key names must match exactly

### Colors.txt Parsing:
```typescript
// The system parses Colors.txt like this:
const line = "primary: #1a1a1a"
const colonIndex = line.indexOf(':')
const key = line.substring(0, colonIndex).trim()  // "primary"
const value = line.substring(colonIndex + 1).trim()  // "#1a1a1a"
```

### Descriptions.txt Parsing:
```typescript
// Same parsing logic as Colors.txt
const line = "tagline: Your tagline here"
const colonIndex = line.indexOf(':')
const key = line.substring(0, colonIndex).trim()  // "tagline"
const value = line.substring(colonIndex + 1).trim()  // "Your tagline here"
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Using `=` instead of `:` (wrong: `primary= #1a1a1a`)
- ❌ Forgetting `#` in hex codes (wrong: `primary: 1a1a1a`)
- ❌ Using 3-digit hex codes (wrong: `primary: #fff`)
- ❌ Wrong key names (wrong: `primaryColor:` instead of `primary:`)
- ❌ Putting value on next line (must be on same line as key)

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] File names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Key names match required keys
- [ ] Hex colors have # prefix
- [ ] Hex colors are 6 digits (lowercase or uppercase OK)
- [ ] Format is `key: value` with colon and space
- [ ] CompanyName.txt has only one line
- [ ] All required keys present in Colors.txt
- [ ] All required keys present in Descriptions.txt
